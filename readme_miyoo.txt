To build, edit "Makefile" to point EXE_PREFIX, CFLAGS, and LIBS to your installation of the Miyoo CFW Buildroot (toolchain), then go into the source directory, and run "make".

To change the font colour in the menu, make sure you create an "etc" directory where you've put the compiled binary, and that you copy "pressstart_font.bmp" in there. OhBoy will load the font from this image file if it is present.
